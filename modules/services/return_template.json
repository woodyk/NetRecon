Minimal Usage Rules
target is always what collect(target) was called with.

port is always the actual port number attempted (even if default like 53, 80, 443).

timestamp is always the current UTC time when the scan began.

open is true if a successful interaction with service; false if port closed, timeout, or refused.

vulnerabilities contains named checks (could be empty if open: false).

summary is a human-focused high-level overview (could be empty if no issues).
